# Read and Display CSV File in Java

This project enables users to upload a CSV file to the server, where the 
file content is processed, and displayed back to the userâ€™s UI inside a data grid. 

The web app is developed entirely in Java using Vaadin Flow (no HTML or JavaScript involved).

## Running the application
The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw spring-boot:run` (on Windows), or `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (on macOS or Linux).

Then, in your browser, open http://localhost:8080/csv.
